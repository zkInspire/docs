# ProofOfInspiration: Sponsor Technology Integration


For code integration please visit Architecture directory

## Project Overview

ProofOfInspiration is a revolutionary decentralized protocol that transforms how creative inspiration is tracked, attributed, and monetized. By leveraging cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure from **Zora Protocol** and **Uniswap**, we create a transparent ecosystem where creators can build upon each other's work while ensuring fair compensation flows through the entire inspiration chain.

##  Uniswap V3 Integration

### Advanced DeFi Infrastructure

Our protocol leverages Uniswap V3's cutting-edge automated market maker (AMM) technology to create sophisticated economic mechanisms around creative inspiration.

### Core Uniswap Features We Utilize

#### 1. **Automated Token Swapping for Royalty Distribution**
- **Multi-Token Support**: Convert royalties between ETH, ZORA, and other tokens automatically
- **Optimal Price Discovery**: Leverage Uniswap's deep liquidity for best swap rates
- **Minimal Slippage**: V3's concentrated liquidity ensures efficient trades
- **Gas Optimization**: Batch operations to minimize transaction costs

#### 2. **Creator Token Liquidity Pools**

    participant Treasury as Treasury Contract
    participant Buyer as NFT Buyer
    
    Buyer->>Treasury: Purchase Derivative NFT
    Treasury->>Pool: Swap ETH â†’ ZORA (Platform Fee)
    Treasury->>Creator: Direct ETH (Creator Share)
    Treasury->>Pool: Add Liquidity (Creator Token/ETH)
    Pool-->>Creator: LP Tokens + Trading Fees
```

#### 3. **Dynamic Pricing Mechanisms**
- **Bonding Curves**: Creator token prices increase with inspiration success
- **Liquidity Incentives**: Creators earn trading fees by providing liquidity
- **Price Discovery**: Market-driven valuation of creative influence

### Advanced Economic Models

#### **Inspiration-to-Earning (I2E) System**
1. **Base Creation**: Creator mints original work, receives creator tokens
2. **Derivative Creation**: New creator builds upon original, triggering revenue share
3. **Automated Distribution**: Uniswap swaps handle multi-token payouts instantly
4. **Compound Growth**: Original creators earn from entire inspiration tree

#### **Liquidity Mining for Creators**
- **Creator Token Farms**: Stake creator tokens to earn platform rewards
- **Inspiration Rewards**: Bonus tokens for works that inspire many derivatives
- **Community Governance**: Use platform tokens to vote on protocol upgrades
