# Solution Statement

zkInspire introduces Proof of Inspiration, a privacy-preserving, onchain verification system for creative works using zero-knowledge proofs. It allows creators to cryptographically prove that a new work was inspired by an existing one without revealing sensitive details of the creative process. This system automatically enforces royalty splits in protocols Zora CoinV4 and Uniswap, aligning attribution with onchain incentives while preserving creator privacy.

## 1. Verifiable Proof of Inspiration with Zero-Knowledge Privacy

zkInspire introduces **Proof of Inspiration**, a cryptographic mechanism that allows creators to **prove influence from prior works** without exposing sensitive drafts or creative processes.

By generating **zero-knowledge proofs of derivation**, creators can declare inspiration **onchain**, enabling **automatic attribution and revenue-sharing** enforced at the protocol level.

Inspiration becomes not just social credit—it’s **provable, enforceable, and rewarded**.

## 2. Onchain Royalty Splits for Derivative Works

With zkInspire’s integration into **Zora CoinV4 minting flows**, each derivative work can carry **embedded revenue-sharing logic**, sending a portion of royalties back to the origin creator automatically.

No need for trust, negotiations, or third-party platforms—**royalty splits are enforced by smart contracts**, making remix culture sustainable and creator-friendly.

**Every new idea strengthens the original creator’s financial foundation.**

---

## 3. zk-Based Inspiration Graph for Ecosystem Intelligence

All relationships between original works and their derivatives form an **onchain, cryptographically verifiable inspiration graph**, **preserving privacy while enabling powerful ecosystem analytics**.

Fans, collectors, and curators can trace the lineage of creative works, surfacing **high-value originators** while still respecting creator privacy.

**The creator economy finally gains a structured, provable creative graph.**

---

## 4. Seamless Integration with Zora and Uniswap for Market Liquidity

By aligning **Proof of Inspiration** directly with **Zora’s CoinV4 contracts** and **Uniswap liquidity pools**, zkInspire ensures that **derivative works and their coins are automatically tradable** with embedded royalty flows.

This makes creative attribution directly tied to **liquid, onchain market incentives**, bringing sustainable economics to the remix era.

**zkInspire transforms creative influence into provable, liquid value.**
