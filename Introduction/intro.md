# Introduction



**zkInspire** introduces **Proof of Inspiration** a zero-knowledge-powered protocol that lets creators **provably link their work to prior creations** without exposing the details. This enables **automatic inspiration royalties** and builds an **onchain graph of creative influence**. Powered by **Zora CoinV4** and integrated with Uniswap V4 liquidity, **zkInspire** makes creative credit provable, private, and profitable.

**What it is**:

An on-chain registry where creators commit hashes of their work upfront → then, any future work (articles, songs, memes, videos) can provably show they derived from that original work using zk-proofs of similarity/inspiration.

**Key**:

If your meme or song inspired someone else → you get automatically paid a percentage if they prove derivation via zk.

Inspired creators prove derivation to credibly build on prior art — but without revealing full creative path or identity.

**ZK Role**:

Prove derivative relationships → without revealing what parts, what influence, or personal connections.
